Input data for the simulation: 

       Population size = 60 
       percent vaccinated = 0.9 
       virus name: Ebola 
       mortality_rate = 0.7 
       reproductive rate = 0.25 
       total percentage of dead Population = 13% 
       total interaction with infected person where a vaccination saved a random person from potentially becoming infected = 1306 
       percentage of population infected at some point before the virus burned out 3
